}
```

## Notes

- https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/SWnnr6***44af_QbWrN1 is used as API address. To use your own API address, you need to update line 43 in the Program.cs file.

- The operation of the program depends on the majority of addresses, if you are going to check a lot of addresses, it is recommended to close the console for speed.
